This is an experiment for my SE-180 report.  I will attempt to recognize mulitple objects in a variety of static images.  

Video will not be considered for the purposes of this experiment.


Many objects will be used.
Training Sets:
  Caltech 101 cars, planes, motorbikes

My training set can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2aDANPLLZA7eFNsdmZtdllMYmM/edit?usp=sharing

The Feature Detection & Description algorithms compared will be: ORB, V1-like (credit to Nicholas Pinto), and V1-like segmented and used with feature bagging.
The Machine Learning algorithm used will be Random Forest.

ORB is used because it is not under patent, and has been shown to perform similarly to SURF & SIFT.
