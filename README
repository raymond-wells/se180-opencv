This is an experiment for my SE-180 report.  I will attempt to recognize mulitple objects in a variety of static images.  

Video will not be considered for the purposes of this experiment.


Many objects will be used.
Training Sets:
  Guitar, Tux, Codemonkey, Wolf, Clock, Laptop, Dragon, Car
  Caltech 101 <- maybe

My training set can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2aDANPLLZA7eFNsdmZtdllMYmM/edit?usp=sharing

The Feature Detection & Description algorithms compared will be:  FAST, ORB, V1-like (thank you Pinto)
The Machine Learning algorithms used will be:  Linear SVM (OpenCV ml), Random Forest (R)

ORB is used because it is not under patent, and has been shown to perform similarly to SURF & SIFT.
